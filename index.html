					<h2>How it Expanded?</h2>


				<p style="font-size: large;">The inception of the company strategy of Nike was born when was <strong>Phil Knight</strong> was still a university student. He already thought that it would be beneficial to the company if it used manufacturing plants in other countries outside the United States, because the labor costs would be much lower. He thought that South Korea and Taiwan were viable locations. Those ideas became a reality. Later, the manufacturing plants were moved to Indonesia and China. Today, the athletic shoes, apparel, equipment and accessories are manufactured in more than 700 plants located in 42 countries. Nike does not own any of the factories. Instead, the manufacturing processes are all outsourced, which is more economical.</p>

				<p style="font-size: large;">To ensure its international expansion, Nike is likewise focused on sustainability. Nike recognizes the fact that to sustain its market dominance, it has to continue delivering innovative products as well as consumer experiences. <strong>Sustainability</strong> means profitability. Consumers worldwide create new markets as well as demand new products and services. This means Nike has to move closer to the market and continue creating new solutions and product customization.</p>
